## Technical Aspect

### Hugging Face Transformers
ðŸ¤— Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. ðŸ¤—Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This provides the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a modelâ€™s life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework, and load it for inference in another. Models can also be exported to a format like ONNX and TorchScript for deployment in production environments.

### LLMs
A large language model (LLM) is a type of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-artificial-intelligence/) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data â€” hence the name "large." LLMs are built on  machine learning specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model.
